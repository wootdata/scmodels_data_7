I call this guy "Cockroach", I had originally designed him for my now defunct line of comic books, but thought he'd look nice in HL DM. I know the face count is pretty high, but what can you expect with four arms?

To use this model for Half-Life simply create a new folder named 'cockroach' (NO QUOTES!) in: 
...\Half-Life\valve\models\player\...
Un-zip the cockroach.mdl and megatron.bmp into the new 'cockroach' folder

Feel free to distribute this .zip along with the README.txt
Have Fun!
