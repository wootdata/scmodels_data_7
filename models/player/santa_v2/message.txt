I whipped this up in about three hours this afternoon -- it's not too
fancy but that's what you get for free ;).  Tell people who download it
that there's no selector bitmap -- they can choose the model from
console though, by typing "model santa" .  There aren't any remap colors
on this model --  but this time of year we're used to seeing a santa on
every corner.  If people want to make their own bitmaps, just call it
"santa.bmp" and put it in the appropriate folder.

 
Happy holidays from me & Valve to the community. Please pass this around
to relevant sites!

PS. model is my (c) 1998.   Free for entertainment use, no paid
distribution without permission -- you know the drill...

PPS for those who don't know, you can look at models in a single player
map with the console -- turn on "developer 1" and "thirdperson" (turning
it off again is "firstperson").  Cam_idealyaw and cam_idealdist will
control the camera's position.
