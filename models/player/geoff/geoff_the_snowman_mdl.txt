  * GEOFF THE SNOWMAN *
  ---------------------

  This is a simple snowman model for half-life.

  The bottom snow ball deforms when he walks which looks a bit messed
  up but i couldn't be bothered to do new animations of assign it to 
  just one of the legs.
 
  Its still looks pretty cool though! I hope you enjoy my model, you 
  can use it wherever you want aslong as i get credit for it.

  cheers
