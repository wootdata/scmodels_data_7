Dr. James PULP FICTION MODELS for Half-Life v1.0
------------------------------------------------

Hi people!

This time I have created multiplayer models looking like VINCENT VEGA and
JULES WINNFIELD from the movie PULP FICTION. They look very cool in Deathmatch,
and they have their cheap black suits with ties, etc...
I hope you like them!


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this models, just copy PFVINCENT.MDL and PFVINCENT.BMP to a folder
called \VALVE\MODELS\PLAYER\PFVINCENT in your Half-Life directory.

For example if Half-Life ist installed in C:\HALF-LIFE you have to create
a folder called C:\HALF-LIFE\VALVE\MODELS\PLAYER\PFVINCENT and copy these files
into it.

Repeat these steps for the JULES model. (You have to replace PFVINCENT with
PFJULES, though)
