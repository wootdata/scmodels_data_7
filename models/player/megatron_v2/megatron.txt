This model is based on "Megatron", the Decpticon leader of the original TransFormers cartoon. It's also a re-release of my first Megatron model, the purpose of which is to address some problems in the original.

WHAT'S BEEN FIXED:
'Megatron' has undergone a general tweaking.
1) The original 'Megatron' didn't actually appear to "hold" the weapons in-game because I'd built the mesh 
too far away from the hand bones.
2) Due to the way 'Megatron's chest was built, in some poses he'd open up at the collar bone.
3) 'Megatron' has been smoothed to eliminate the boxiness of 'Megatron'.
4) 'Megatron' has been optimized. I managed to do away with 76 polys, without detracting from 
the model in the least.

WHAT'S NEW:
1) After months of practice with Paintshop Pro 6, I've given this new 'Megatron' a better skin.  Granted, I'm no Bamphalas, but they're getting better.

Come and see what other models I've made at:
