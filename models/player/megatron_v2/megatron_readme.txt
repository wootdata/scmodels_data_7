MEGATRON and DECEPTICONS are trademarks of Hasbro. (I think.)

To use this model for Half-Life simply create a new folder named 'megatron' (NO QUOTES!) in: 
...\Half-Life\valve\models\player\...
Un-zip the megatron.mdl and megatron.bmp into the new megatron folder
The Decepticon symbol (decepticon.bmp) should be cut, then pasted into:
...\Half-Life\logos

Feel free to distribute this .zip along with the README.txt
Have Fun!
